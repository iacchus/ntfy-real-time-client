``ntfy-real-time-client``
===============================

THIS IS NOT READY YET
===============================

https://github.com/iacchus/python-pushover-open-client/blob/main/src/python_pushover_open_client/__init__.py

Command line app and framework for receiving and processing NTFY push notifications in real time.

.. _pyscaffold-notes:

Features
========

* Receive notifications real time via NTFY websocket server.
* Execute python funcions via commands received by notification, passing arguments as ``*args``.
* Execute shell commands, passing arguments.
* Execute python functions to all received notifications (*eg.*,. you can use 
  ``Popen`` to send all notifications to ``notify-send``.)
* Can be run as a system service, enabling your scripts from boot time.
* It is being developed with facilities to make it easy subclassing.

Installing
==========

.. code:: sh

    pip install ntfy-real-time-client

**Python minimum version 3.10** is needed.

Setting Up
==========


u can start by setting three required envvars: ``NTFY_SERVER_HOSTNAME``, ``NTFY_TOPIC`` and ``NTFY_TOKEN``.

file: ``~/.zshrc`` or ``~/.bashrc`` etc
--------------------------------------------

.. code:: sh

  export NTFY_SERVER_HOSTNAME="ntfy.yourdomain.comm"
  export NTFY_TOPIC="general"
  export NTFY_TOKEN="tk_mahb1gt0k3nz4321"

Then restart the shell.

Using
=====

Command line
------------

Our command line ``ntfy-real-time-client`` still needs more functions,
but we already have one. `His whole interface is here`_.

.. code:: sh

    ntfy-real-time-client json

This command outputs new received notifications and can be used to pipe for
your own scripts to be processed.

Programatically
---------------

Here is an example script of how using decorators to use the lib. More examples
will be added soon, as there are more decorators/functions to be used.

file: ``notify.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from subprocess import Popen

    from ntfy_real_time_client import register_command
    from ntfy_real_time_client import register_parser
    from ntfy_real_time_client import NTFYClientRealTime


    # Let's use a decorator to registrate a command function; it will be executed
    # when a message with `mycmd_rawdata` as the first word is received. All
    # the arguments, *ie.*, all the words in the notification, including
    # `mycmd_rawdata` will be passed to ``*args``:

    @register_command
    def mycmd_rawdata(*args, raw_data=None):
        print("RAW DATA IS:", raw_data)

    # this decorator register a parser which is executed for each new
    # notification received; here we have two examples:

    @register_parser
    def my_notify_send_parser(raw_data=None):
        args_str = "notify-send \"{message}\"".format(message=raw_data["message"])
        Popen(args=args_str, shell=True)


    @register_parser
    def my_print_parser(raw_data=None):
        print("MESSAGE RECEIVED:", raw_data)

    # this instantiates the NTFY websocket class and runs it
    client = NTFYClientRealTime()
    client.run_forever()

You can save the script above to a file (*eg*. ``~/notify.py``), then make it
executable and run, after you have `installed the package`_  and
`entered your NTFY credentials`_:

.. code:: sh

    chmod +x notify.py
    ./notify.py

Then while it is running,  try to send a notification to the device (or all
the devices) via `NTFY website`_ or other notification sending app.

Full featured NTFY client using this lib
============================================

Send notification to desktop (if you use ``notify-send``) and show the
notification on the terminal executing it.

You can even create a systemd service to always receive the notifications on
desktop automatically. (In this case, you can delete the terminal printing
lines.)

file: ``python-client.py``
--------------------------

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from subprocess import Popen

    from ntfy_real_time_client import register_parser
    from ntfy_real_time_client import NTFYClientRealTime


    PERMANENT_NOTIFICATION = True  # should notifications stay until clicked?

    # shows notifications on Desktop using `notify-send`

    @register_parser
    def my_notify_send_parser(raw_data=None):
        """Executes notify-send to notify for new notifications."""

        message = raw_data['message']
        title = raw_data['title'] if raw_data['title'] else '_'

        is_permanent = ["-t", "0"] if PERMANENT_NOTIFICATION else []

        args = ['notify-send', *is_permanent, title, message ]

        Popen(args=args)

    # prints to the terminal

    @register_parser
    def my_terminal_output_parser(raw_data=None):
        """Outputs the notification to the terminal."""

        print(raw_data)

        message = raw_data['message']
        title = raw_data['title'] if raw_data['title'] else '_'

        print(f"{title}\n{message}", end="\n\n")

    # this instantiates the NTFY websocket class and runs it:

    client = NTFYClientRealTime()
    client.run_forever()


Command line tool
-----------------

Let's use Python's `click` to make a fancy interface to this program?

Contributing
============

Please open an issue if you want to contribute with code. Or use discussions.

The sources' package in reality contain only two files:

* `__init__.py <https://github.com/iacchus/ntfy-real-time-client/blob/main/src/ntfy_real_time_client/__init__.py>`_ - This contains the ``ntfy_real_time_client`` library itself.
* `__main__.py <https://github.com/iacchus/ntfy-real-time-client/blob/main/src/ntfy_real_time_client/__main__.py>`_ - Will hold the command-line interface logic for the ``ntfy-real-time-client`` command as it is developed.

Support
=======

You can open a issue or a message in discussions for support in using/getting
the code.

Is it ready already?
